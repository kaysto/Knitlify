# Description
Knitlify is a responsive webpage devoted to providing information and inspiration to those looking to get into any kind of needlework. The page features links to articles on how to get started with each type of craft, as well as links to other related pages and articles as well. 

# Project Status
The goal for this project was to create a responsive and simple page, but work is continuing to be done to make the site even more interactive(i.e. an actual way to submit the contact form/a space for a message board/etc).
